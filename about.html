				<p>
					Keep positive attitude,for example, there is no reason to look at life any other way than with a glass-half-full mentality. With that being said, positive attitude; helps make sure you live your life feeling happy and stress-free. Sexual health;if a teen dtates one person for a while, she might feel pressured to become sexually intimate,in that case, friends will be curiuos and question whether she and her dating partner have "done it". This is a good time for a parent to start talking to a teen about making right decisions. Reassure her that just because she's been dating the same person for a while does not mean she has to have sex, especially if she's not ready, by then she'll make her own decison.
